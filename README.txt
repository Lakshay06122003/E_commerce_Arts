Documenting my code: "JAVASCRIPT ONLY" (i created two java script files because i found it was more easy and loaded faster than 1 big code rendering again and again for all pages. it wasnt mentioned in the assignment to use 1 file only so i used two of them.)

    scipt-about.js only---

1) from lines 1 to 11 in script-about.js , i used functions to animate my photo gallery . when a user clicks on a picture others get hidden.and the selected image appears on the front.
  there is also a cross option which closes the opened image.

  scipt.js only---

1)from lines 2 to 26 i wrote blur and focus functions . so if a user typing in the form then the border changes , but when it mousesout it changes its border again.

2)from lines 29 to 33 , i wrote the code for the blogs. so when a user is reading a blog and clicks on it . it hightights the blogs so it becomes easy for the user to keep track of it.

3)from lines 38 to 63, i wrote the code for colour palattes . so that the user can select the color scheme he/she likes.
